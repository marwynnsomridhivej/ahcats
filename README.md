`ahcats` is a fully async Python wrapper for the HTTP Cats API.

Thank you for using `ahcats`! This is my first API wrapper and I appreciate your support! This wrapper is completely async.

I am only the creator of this wrapper library. The creator of the HTTP Cats API is [Rog√©rio Vicente](https://github.com/rogeriopvl)
